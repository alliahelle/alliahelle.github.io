			<h2> CMSC subject: <span style="color:#4682b4"> CMSC 12 </span> </h2>
			<p> I really enjoyed every CMSC subject that I have taken so far, but CMSC 12 is my absolute favorite. I was not intimidated by the course even though it was the first CMSC subject in our curriculum. Instead, I found the course easy to understand, fun, and a great start in learning programming. </p>

			<h2> GE: <span style="color:#4682b4"> MATH 10 </span> </h2>
			<p> I actually did not plan on taking this subject because I was expecting it to be hard since it is associated with math, but the course was really fun and interesting. I appreciate how it broadened my understanding and changed my perception towards Mathematics. Overall, it was a great learning experience. </p>
